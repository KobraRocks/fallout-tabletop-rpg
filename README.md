# SFT RPG
Is a desktop and a mobile app that support character management for the Fallout Tabletop RPG.

when I started to play this game with my kid we used paper and pencil. Then I told myself "WTF", it would be nice to have a mobile app to help us track our respective player stats and inventory, while the Game Master is taking care of the adventure.

So there I am developing a web app that works on a mobile via a browser.
